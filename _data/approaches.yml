    title: "Scalability Architecture Approach"
    category: "architecture"
    
    methodology: |
      When designing systems that need to scale, I follow a systematic approach:
      1. Analyze current bottlenecks and constraints
      2. Design for horizontal scaling
      3. Implement caching strategies
      4. Use microservices for independent scaling
      5. Monitor and optimize continuously

      - "Microservices Architecture"
      - "Event-Driven Architecture"
      - "Caching Strategies (Redis, CDN)"

      - "Database Sharding/Replication"
    
    decision_making_process: |
      - Evaluate current system performance metrics
      - Identify scaling bottlenecks
      - Research proven patterns for similar use cases
